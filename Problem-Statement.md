## üìù Problem Statement  

In today‚Äôs fast-paced world, the demand for **online food ordering and delivery platforms** has skyrocketed.  
Customers expect quick, reliable, and secure services where they can browse restaurants, order meals, and make payments seamlessly.  

However, building such a system comes with multiple challenges:  
- Efficient **user-role management** for customers, restaurant owners, delivery agents, and admins.  
- **Scalable architecture** to handle large numbers of concurrent orders and transactions.  
- Secure **authentication and authorization** to protect sensitive data.  
- Reliable **inter-service communication** between independent microservices.  
- Real-time **event-driven notifications** for order updates and payments.  
- Integration of **payment and delivery management** with fault tolerance and monitoring.  

The **Food Delivery Application** aims to solve these challenges by implementing a **Spring Boot microservices-based architecture** with features like service discovery, API gateway, JWT security, Kafka-based event streaming, and role-based access control.  

This system ensures **scalability, maintainability, and security**, making it suitable for real-world food delivery scenarios.
